title:  "What is this about?"

As some of you might be aware, I live with a constant urge to learn.

This was fun for a while, especially as a child and in school, where I was one of the few *weird ones* who actually liked school.

But then, at some point, you get a job. You learn again for a while, and then it comes down on you : you know mostly everything about your field. Not everything, just enough to get how things work, to do a pretty good job and be appreciated by your co-workers.

But your brain still wants to learn. So you spend endless evenings reading about other jobs, feel it is exciting for a while and then move on to your new interest.

And this week, it hit me : why am I filling my brain like that? How is this useful?

For a while I thought about being a teacher or something along those lines, but to become a teacher, you pretty much need to be an *expert* in your field, something I always get bored too fast to get at.

And then I found [this post](https://betterhumans.coach.me/are-you-a-multipotentialite-confessions-from-a-man-with-obsessive-learning-disorder-82e400df53d3) by Niklas Goeke, which pretty much says : share what you learn, keep going. The dots will connect someday. And it was such a relief.

So here it is, this blog will be about the things I learn. Not expert knowledge, just the gist of it, the part I found useful and interesting. A multipotentialite's public notebook.
